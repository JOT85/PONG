# PONG
The classic pong game, inspired by the original Atari Pong, written in JavaScript for the browser or electron.

The main.js and package.json are for electron, so the app folder can be dumped as is with electron and it works great :)

Live version available at <a href="https://www.jotpot.co.uk/pong">jotpot.co.uk/pong</a>

To modify the controls, edit the script in the HTML file.

Also, this was made as a bit of fun for a day so isn't perfect, and yes, I know the code is a mess. It is because I started without a real plan...
